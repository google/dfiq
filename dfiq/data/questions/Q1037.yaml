type: question
description: >
  PsExec is a command-line tool that allows you to execute commands on remote
  computers. It is part of the Sysinternals suite of tools, which are a
  collection of free and open-source utilities for Windows system
  administration.  It works by establishing a remote connection to the target
  computer and then executing the specified command. In order to do this, it
  copies an executable to the target system and installs a service to run that
  executable.
