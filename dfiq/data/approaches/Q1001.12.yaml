    File downloads by some web browsers create a specific pattern of events
    on the file system. We can use this to see browser downloads using NTFS change
    journal (USN journal) records.

    Chrome downloads on Windows create a specific pattern of events on the file system:

    1.  **Download starts with a `FILE CREATE` event to `.tmp` file; older Chrome versions
        have been observed creating four character file names (like `7DEE.tmp`)
        while newer versions use file names consistent with Version 4 UUIDs
        (like `183011a0-f96c-4c98-b71b-ab8754fb0e0e.tmp`).
    1.  That `.tmp` file might be `RENAME`d to `Unconfirmed [6 digits].crdownload`. 
    1.  If [2] `Unconfirmed...crdownload` `RENAME` didn't happen, the `.tmp` file is
        renamed to the eventual filename (with extension) with `.crdownload` appended
        at the end (like `cat.jpg.crdownload`). **In either case ([2] or [3]), at
        this point we have a file ending in .crdownload.**
    1.  Once the download completes, the `.crdownload` suffix is removed via a
        `USN_REASON_RENAME_OLD_NAME` event, leaving the downloaded file with its final name.

    Since [4] above captures the key information about the file download, we can
    search change journal records for it.

  notes:
    covered:
      - Chrome downloads to an NTFS volume
    not_covered:
      - All other browsers.
      - Downloads from other Chromium/Chrome-based browsers _might_ be collected via this
        method, but testing is necessary to confirm.
      - Downloads on file systems other than NTFS.
      - Downloads that would be covered, but happened long enough ago that the USN Journal
        records that would show it have been deleted.
