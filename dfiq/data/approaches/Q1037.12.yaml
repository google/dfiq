  details: >
    Parse the Windows Security Event Log and look for the PsExeSvc service being
    installed.

    Windows systems can be set to log new service installations to the System
    event log. The logs contain the new service name, service file name, and
    more. When used to access a remote system, PsExec installs a service (by
    default named `PSEXESVC`) on the target system.

  notes:
    covered:
      - Installations of the PsExeSvc Service on Windows systems with logging
        enabled.
    not_covered:
      - Many factors can impact log retention; if the event log containing the
        relevant event has been deleted, it won't be found by this approach.
      - Instances when the PsExeSvc service has been renamed.
