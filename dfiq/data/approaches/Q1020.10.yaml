    Parse URL visit records from web browsers' own databases.

    Most web browsers track URL visits (at least in non-Incognito/private
    sessions) in local artifacts on the system. We can collect and review these
    records. This approach is useful when you have remote access to a system
    (via GRR for example) or a disk image.

        Collect local browser history artifacts. These are often in the form of
        SQLite databases and JSON files in multiple directories.
