    Parse Windows Prefetch files and look for PsExec.

    Windows Prefetch files are designed to speed up application start times. To do this, they
    store information about recently launched applications, including the file name of the
    executable and the number of times it has been run.

  notes:
    covered:
      - Executions of PsExec on Windows systems with Prefetch enabled.
    not_covered:
      - Systems where the Prefetch service has been disabled.
      - There is a maximum number of `.pf` allowed by Windows (the number varies by Windows
        version). If too many other Prefetch files were created, the PsExec Prefetch file may have
        been deleted, and thus will not be parsed.
      - Instances when the PsExec executable has been renamed.
      - Non-Windows systems, as the Prefetch service is Windows-only.
