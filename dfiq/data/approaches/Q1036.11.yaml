  details: >
    Parse the Windows Security Event Log and look for PsExec processes being
    created.

    Windows systems can be set to log new process creation events to the
    Security event log. The logs contain the new process name, process ID,
    parent process name, process creation time, and many more useful fields.

  notes:
    covered:
      - Executions of PsExec on Windows systems with logging enabled.
    not_covered:
      - Many factors can impact log retention; if the event log containing the
        relevant event has been deleted, it won't be found by this approach.
      - Instances when the PsExec executable has been renamed.
