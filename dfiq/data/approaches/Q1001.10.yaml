display_name: Collect download records from local browser artifacts

  summary: Parse download records from web browsers' own databases.
  details: >
    Most web browsers track file downloads (at least in non-Incognito/private
    sessions) in local artifacts on the system. We can collect and review
    these records. This approach is useful when you have remote access to a
    system (via GRR for example) or a disk image.
