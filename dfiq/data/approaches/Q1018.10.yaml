  details: >
    CrowdStrike records the source process ID (ContextProcessId) for DNSRequest
    event.

    Crowdstrike is a detection platform, not a logging platform, so not all DNS
    requests are logged. Content Filter needs to be enabled to capture DNS
    request queries.

                Domain(s)` the columns `PID`, `Process ID`, and `File Name` give
                the source process information for the DNS query.
