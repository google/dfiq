# Questions

**Questions are the core of DFIQ.** All other DFIQ components are relative to Questions: Approaches
describe how to answer the Questions, and Scenarios and Facets organize the Questions logically. Below
is an index of all the Questions that are defined as part of DFIQ.

Some quick facts about Questions in DFIQ:

- Questions should be small enough in scope that they can be readily answered
- A single Question can be reused in multiple different Facets
- If a Question has any Approaches defined, it will render as a link to the detailed Question page

!!! Note
    Not all the Questions have Approaches defined; in fact, most don't at the moment.
    If you'd like to contribute an idea for a new Question, or a new Approach for answering an
    existing Question, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/google/dfiq/issues/new/choose).
