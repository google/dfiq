# Approaches

!!! Note
    There are often multiple ways to approach answering a question.
    This section explains the approaches considered, how they work, and any
    benefits or drawbacks to each. All these approaches have different pros
    and cons. They can be used individually or in conjunction.

## Collect download records from local browser artifacts
### üóÇÔ∏è Explanation
Parse download records from web browsers' own databases.

Most web browsers track file downloads (at least in non-Incognito/private
sessions) in local artifacts on the system. We can collect and review
these records. This approach is useful when you have remote access to a
system (via GRR for example) or a disk image.

 - [Chrome](https://forensics.wiki/google_chrome/#downloadsstart_time), [Firefox](https://forensics.wiki/mozilla_firefox/#downloads), and [Safari](https://forensics.wiki/apple_safari/#downloads) downloads on ForensicsWiki
 - [Web Browsers on ForensicArtifacts](https://github.com/ForensicArtifacts/artifacts/blob/main/data/webbrowser.yaml)

### üìù Notes

Each approach comes with certain caveats or limitations. These can often
be tacit knowledge or assumed that "everyone knows that" (even though they
don't). This can lead to incorrect assumptions and analysis.
Explicitly stating what is covered and not covered by the approach reduces
ambiguity.

!!! success "Covered"

     - Chrome downloads. Beyond "stable" Chrome, this also includes Chromium, Chrome Canary, Chrome Beta, and other Chromium-based browsers (Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Opera) on Windows, macOS, and Linux
     - Safari downloads
     - Includes downloads from all Chrome profiles

!!! failure "Not Covered"

     - Firefox downloads
     - Downloads on any other browsers
     - Browsers installed in non-standard paths
     - Downloads made during Incognito sessions


### üíæ Data

The following data source(s) are needed for this approach to the question.

**Description**
:  Collect local browser history artifacts. These are often in the form of SQLite databases and JSON files in multiple directories.


**Type**
:  [ForensicArtifact](https://github.com/ForensicArtifacts/artifacts#digital-forensics-artifacts-repository)

**Value**
:  BrowserHistory ([view on GitHub](https://github.com/ForensicArtifacts/artifacts/search?q=BrowserHistory))

### ‚öôÔ∏è Processors

A processor is what takes the [data](#üíæ-data) collected and processes it in
some way to produce structured data for an investigator to review. Multiple
processor options can be defined, as there are often multiple programs capable
of doing similar processing. Plaso is an example of a processor (it processes
raw artifacts into a timeline). After the data is processed, additional analysis
steps may be needed to answer the question.

The following processors can process the raw data specified above. Explicit
instructions on how to run the processor are *not* included here, but any
relevant configuration options are.


=== "Plaso"
    More information on [Plaso](https://forensics.wiki/plaso).

    Recommended options:

    ```
     --parsers webhist
    ```

    #### üìä Analysis

    After processing the raw data, further analysis steps are necessary to answer
    the question. After loading Plaso's output into one of these
    analysis platforms, use the following steps to refine the data to answer the
    question.


    OpenSearch

    1. Filter the results to just file downloads
       - OpenSearch query:

         ```
         data_type:("chrome:history:file_downloaded" OR "safari:downloads:entry")
         ```

    Python Notebook

    1. Filter the results to just file downloads
       - Python code:

         ```
         df.query('data_type in ("chrome:history:file_downloaded", "safari:downloads:entry")')
         ```
=== "Hindsight"
    More information on [Hindsight](https://forensics.wiki/hindsight).

    Recommended options:

    ```
     --format jsonl
    ```

    #### üìä Analysis

    After processing the raw data, further analysis steps are necessary to answer
    the question. After loading Hindsight's output into one of these
    analysis platforms, use the following steps to refine the data to answer the
    question.


    OpenSearch

    1. Filter the results to just file downloads. Hindsight only supports Chromium-based browsers (including Microsoft Edge) and not Firefox or Safari.

       - OpenSearch query:

         ```
         data_type:"chrome:history:file_downloaded"
         ```

    Python Notebook

    1. Filter the results to just file downloads. Hindsight only supports Chromium-based browsers (including Microsoft Edge) and not Firefox or Safari.

       - Python code:

         ```
         df.query('data_type == "chrome:history:file_downloaded"')
         ```
## Detect browser downloads via file system event logs
### üóÇÔ∏è Explanation
File downloads by some web browsers create a specific pattern of events
on the file system. We can use this to see browser downloads using file system
logs (like Santa).

Chrome downloads on macOS create a specific pattern of file system events:

1.  **Download starts with a `WRITE` event to a temp file named like
    `.com.google.Chrome.avXx0U`** (the suffix looks to be 6 letters/numbers). 
1.  That .com.google.Chrome... temp file might be `RENAME`d to `Unconfirmed [6 
    digits].crdownload`. 
1.  If [2] `Unconfirmed...crdownload` `RENAME` didn't happen, the .com.google.
    temp file is renamed to the eventual filename (with extension) with
    `.crdownload` appended at the end (like `cat.jpg.crdownload`). **In either
    case ([2] or [3]), at this point we have a file ending in .crdownload.**
1.  Once the download completes, the `.crdownload` suffix is removed via a
    `RENAME` event, leaving the downloaded file with its final name.

Since [4] above captures the key information about the file download, we can
search file system logs for it.


### üìù Notes

Each approach comes with certain caveats or limitations. These can often
be tacit knowledge or assumed that "everyone knows that" (even though they
don't). This can lead to incorrect assumptions and analysis.
Explicitly stating what is covered and not covered by the approach reduces
ambiguity.

!!! success "Covered"

     - Chrome downloads on macOS (given that Santa was installed and logging enabled)

!!! failure "Not Covered"

     - All other browsers
     - Downloads from other Chromium/Chrome-based browsers _might_ be collected via this method, but testing is necessary to confirm.
     - Downloads that occurred on macOS with Santa, but during a time period for which there are no Santa logs (out of retention or Santa was disabled).


### üíæ Data

The following data source(s) are needed for this approach to the question.

**Description**
:  Santa logs stored on the local disk; they may also be centralized off-system, but this artifact does not include those.


**Type**
:  [ForensicArtifact](https://github.com/ForensicArtifacts/artifacts#digital-forensics-artifacts-repository)

**Value**
:  SantaLogs ([view on GitHub](https://github.com/ForensicArtifacts/artifacts/search?q=SantaLogs))

    After processing the raw data, further analysis steps are necessary to answer
    the question. After loading Plaso's output into one of these
    analysis platforms, use the following steps to refine the data to answer the
    question.


    OpenSearch

    1. Filter the results to file system rename events where the original file name ended with `.crdownload`.
       - OpenSearch query:

         ```
         data_type:"santa:file_system_event" action:RENAME file_path:"*\.crdownload"
         ```
## Detect browser downloads via change journal records
### üóÇÔ∏è Explanation
File downloads by some web browsers create a specific pattern of events
on the file system. We can use this to see browser downloads using NTFS change
journal (USN journal) records.

Chrome downloads on Windows create a specific pattern of events on the file system:

1.  **Download starts with a `FILE CREATE` event to `.tmp` file; older Chrome versions
    have been observed creating four character file names (like `7DEE.tmp`)
    while newer versions use file names consistent with Version 4 UUIDs
    (like `183011a0-f96c-4c98-b71b-ab8754fb0e0e.tmp`).
1.  That `.tmp` file might be `RENAME`d to `Unconfirmed [6 digits].crdownload`. 
1.  If [2] `Unconfirmed...crdownload` `RENAME` didn't happen, the `.tmp` file is
    renamed to the eventual filename (with extension) with `.crdownload` appended
    at the end (like `cat.jpg.crdownload`). **In either case ([2] or [3]), at
    this point we have a file ending in .crdownload.**
1.  Once the download completes, the `.crdownload` suffix is removed via a
    `USN_REASON_RENAME_OLD_NAME` event, leaving the downloaded file with its final name.

Since [4] above captures the key information about the file download, we can
search change journal records for it.

### üìù Notes

be tacit knowledge or assumed that "everyone knows that" (even though they
don't). This can lead to incorrect assumptions and analysis.
Explicitly stating what is covered and not covered by the approach reduces

!!! success "Covered"

     - Chrome downloads to an NTFS volume

!!! failure "Not Covered"

     - All other browsers.
     - Downloads from other Chromium/Chrome-based browsers _might_ be collected via this method, but testing is necessary to confirm.
     - Downloads on file systems other than NTFS.
     - Downloads that would be covered, but happened long enough ago that the USN Journal records that would show it have been deleted.


### üíæ Data

The following data source(s) are needed for this approach to the question.

**Description**
:  The NTFS $UsnJnrl file system metadata file. This ForensicArtifact definition does not include the $J alternate data stream, but many tools collect it anyway.


**Type**
:  [ForensicArtifact](https://github.com/ForensicArtifacts/artifacts#digital-forensics-artifacts-repository)

         ```

    1. Select and search for the `file_reference` value for an event of interest from the previous query. There should be one with the same timestamp as your previous event and its `filename` value is the download's final name.
       - OpenSearch query:

         ```
         data_type:"fs:ntfs:usn_change" {file_reference value} "USN_REASON_RENAME_NEW_NAME"
         ```
