# Approaches

!!! Note
    There are often multiple ways to approach answering a question.
    This section explains the approaches considered, how they work, and any
    benefits or drawbacks to each. All these approaches have different pros
    and cons. They can be used individually or in conjunction.

## Use Crowdstrike "Bulk Domains" to link source processes to DNS queries
### üóÇÔ∏è Explanation
CrowdStrike records the source process ID (ContextProcessId) for DNSRequest event.

Crowdstrike is a detection platform, not a logging platform, so not all DNS requests are logged.
Content Filter needs to be enabled to capture DNS request queries.

### üìù Notes

Each approach comes with certain caveats or limitations. These can often
be tacit knowledge or assumed that "everyone knows that" (even though they
don't). This can lead to incorrect assumptions and analysis.
Explicitly stating what is covered and not covered by the approach reduces
ambiguity.

!!! success "Covered"

     - Mac, Linux, and Windows hosts with a CrowdStrike Falcon agent

!!! failure "Not Covered"

     - Hosts with the Falcon agent, but where the Content Filter is not enabled


### üíæ Data

The following data source(s) are needed for this approach to the question.


  - CrowdStrike: DnsRequest

### ‚öôÔ∏è Processors

A processor is what takes the [data](#üíæ-data) collected and processes it in
some way to produce structured data for an investigator to review. Multiple
processor options can be defined, as there are often multiple programs capable
of doing similar processing. Plaso is an example of a processor (it processes
raw artifacts into a timeline). After the data is processed, additional analysis
steps may be needed to answer the question.

The following processors can process the raw data specified above. Explicit
instructions on how to run the processor are *not* included here, but any
relevant configuration options are.

    #### üìä Analysis

    After processing the raw data, further analysis steps are necessary to answer
    the question. After loading Crowdstrike Investigate (Ui)'s output into one of these
    analysis platforms, use the following steps to refine the data to answer the
    question.


    Manual

    1. UI steps in Investigate Bulk domains
      - Type: GUI
      - Value: In the second table, `Process that looked up specified Domain(s)` the columns  `PID`, `Process ID`, and `File Name` give the source process information for the  DNS query.


## Use Crowdstrike event search to link source processes to DNS queries
### üóÇÔ∏è Explanation
CrowdStrike records the source process ID (ContextProcessId) for DNSRequest event.

Crowdstrike is a detection platform, not a logging platform, so not all DNS requests are logged.
Content Filter needs to be enabled to capture DNS request queries.

    After processing the raw data, further analysis steps are necessary to answer
    the question. After loading Splunk's output into one of these
    analysis platforms, use the following steps to refine the data to answer the
    question.


    Splunk-Query

    1. Query joining DNS Request events and executions gives the source for each DNS query
      - Type: splunk-query
      - Value: ComputerName="{hostname}" event_simpleName=ProcessRollup* | rename TargetProcessId_decimal as ContextProcessId_decimal | join ContextProcessId_decimal [search ComputerName="{hostname}" event_simpleName=DnsRequest | fields ContextProcessId_decimal, DomainName] | table _time, DomainName, ImageFileName

## Use Sysmon (Event ID 22) to link source processes to DNS queries
### üóÇÔ∏è Explanation
Sysmon Event ID 22 DnsQuery stores source process ID

DNS Query, event ID 22, records a DNS query being issued by a specific host and the originating process.

    Splunk-Query

    1. Query for Sysmon Event ID 22 and extracting the parent process ID and path.
      - Type: splunk-query
      - Value: source="xmlwineventlog:microsoft-windows-sysmon/operational" EventCode=22 | table _time, host, process_id, process_path

    analysis platforms, use the following steps to refine the data to answer the
    question.


    OpenSearch

    1. Query for Sysmon Event ID 22 events
       - OpenSearch query:

         ```
         data_type:"windows:evtx:record" source_name:"Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon" event_identifier:22
         ```

    1. Determine the source process in relevant event(s)
      - Type: manual
      - Value: Plaso (as of v20230717) doesn't parse the `xml_string` into attributes. Examine the `xml_string`; the value after `<Data Name="Image">` is the process that made the DNS query.



    Python Notebook

    1. Query for Sysmon Event ID 22 events
       - Python code:

         ```
         df.df.query('data_type == "windows:evtx:record" and source_name == "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon" and event_identifier == 22')
         ```

    1. Extract `Image` attribute
       - Python code:

         ```
         df.df['process'] = df['xml_string'].str.extract(r'<Data Name="Image">(.*?)</Data>')
         ```

    1. Extract `QueryName` attribute
       - Python code:

         ```
         df.df['query'] = df['xml_string'].str.extract(r'<Data Name="QueryName">(.*?)</Data>')
         ```

    1. Filter down to DNS query of interest
       - Python code:

         ```
         df.df[df.query.str.contains('<domain>')]
         ```
