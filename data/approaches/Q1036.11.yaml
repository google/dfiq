description:
  summary: Parse the Windows Security Event Log and look for PsExec processes being created.
  details: >
    Windows systems can be set to log new process creation events to the Security event log. The
    logs contain the new process name, process ID, parent process name, process creation time, and
    many more useful fields.

    covered:
      - Executions of PsExec on Windows systems with logging enabled.
    not_covered:
      - Many factors can impact log retention; if the event log containing the relevant event has
        been deleted, it won't be found by this approach.
      - Instances when the PsExec executable has been renamed.
