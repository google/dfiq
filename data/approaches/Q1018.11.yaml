display_name: Use Crowdstrike event search to link source processes to DNS queries
type: approach

description:
  summary: CrowdStrike records the source process ID (ContextProcessId) for DNSRequest event.
  details: >
    Crowdstrike is a detection platform, not a logging platform, so not all DNS requests are logged.
    Content Filter needs to be enabled to capture DNS request queries.
