description:
  summary: Parse the Windows Security Event Log and look for the PsExeSvc service being installed.
  details: >
    Windows systems can be set to log new service installations to the System event log. The
    logs contain the new service name, service file name, and more. When used to access a remote
    system, PsExec installs a service (by default named `PSEXESVC`) on the target system.
