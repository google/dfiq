display_name: Detect browser downloads via file system event logs

  summary: File downloads by some web browsers create a specific pattern of events
    on the file system. We can use this to see browser downloads using file system
    logs (like Santa).
  details: |
    Chrome downloads on macOS create a specific pattern of file system events:

    1.  **Download starts with a `WRITE` event to a temp file named like
        `.com.google.Chrome.avXx0U`** (the suffix looks to be 6 letters/numbers). 
    1.  That .com.google.Chrome... temp file might be `RENAME`d to `Unconfirmed [6 
        digits].crdownload`. 
    1.  If [2] `Unconfirmed...crdownload` `RENAME` didn't happen, the .com.google.
        temp file is renamed to the eventual filename (with extension) with
        `.crdownload` appended at the end (like `cat.jpg.crdownload`). **In either
        case ([2] or [3]), at this point we have a file ending in .crdownload.**
    1.  Once the download completes, the `.crdownload` suffix is removed via a
        `RENAME` event, leaving the downloaded file with its final name.

    Since [4] above captures the key information about the file download, we can
    search file system logs for it.

      value: Santa logs stored on the local disk; they may also be centralized off-system,
        but this artifact does not include those.
  notes:
    covered:
      - Chrome downloads on macOS (given that Santa was installed and logging enabled)
    not_covered:
      - All other browsers
      - Downloads from other Chromium/Chrome-based browsers _might_ be collected via this
        method, but testing is necessary to confirm.
      - Downloads that occurred on macOS with Santa, but during a time period for which 
        there are no Santa logs (out of retention or Santa was disabled).
